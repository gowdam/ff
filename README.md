# Calculator-App
 
Inputs are absolutely vital to learn as a programmer. Creating a calculator allows users to perform simple tasks using simple operations like multiplication and division.

It may not be the most exciting application, but you can rest assured itâ€™s absolutely necessary for a beginning programmer.

We have designed this project in such a way that you can continue with the same project to implement much more advanced things at a later stage. We will convert this tiny app into a Progressive Web App, and will deploy it on your own domain with a basic CI/CD pipeline. So make sure you give your best at it.

**The Task**

Replicate the calculator app on your phone. Use it as a reference to obtain exact functional as well as visual copy of the app.

Expectations

- Use basics of HTML to obtain the structure.
- Use basics of CSS to obtain the exact look
- The code should be pushed to GitHub from the first commit. This is an important criteria for passing this task as it is crucial 
  to completely understand git and how it works at this stage. This is also important because good versioned code is important for 
  Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD).

Some points to remember:

- Create a simple web page which has the basic functionality. Do check carefully how the C/CE buttons work.
- Do not worry about responsive design right now. Use fixed width and height. We will convert it to responsive design later on.
- Use <div> tags to create the structure of the app. Remember that there is one main area for the display and the other will be for    
  the input section (keypad/numpad)
- Use basic CSS classes for giving base attributes and then specific classes based on the design of your app. Try to keep things 
  very simple and minimal.


**Deadline**: 1 Week (from project commencement)
